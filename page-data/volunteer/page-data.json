We analyzed the process of conviction vacation in Washington state, and have identified opportunities to use technology to streamline the process. Our efforts at the National Day of Civic Hacking on September 21st focused on automating eligibility calculation for conviction vacation. We see future opportunity to streamline the completion of the required forms. We are investigating the feasibility of a Turbo Tax style interface to simplify this process, and then e-filing the forms in counties where it is permitted."},"impact":{"title":"What is the social impact of CVP, where does this project fit into larger context?","description":"While the need for social justice is not news to anyone, the many forms injustice and excessive punishment comes in can be surprising!

We engage regularly, not just through our respective skill-sets, but with the team and project as a whole! This commitment amounts to, on average, about three hours every week for at least six months."},"status":{"title":"Is this project in active development and what can I expect to work on?","description":"Like any iterative, agile development process, nothing is ever quite done! There’s plenty of work to be done by anyone with a skill-set useful in a modern software development life cycle!"},"contact":{"title":"How do I get started?","description":"After reaching out to us, you and Seamus will have a Zoom chat about yourself, the project, and how the two could fit together!
